# Creating-an-Interpreter

Following the Crafting Interpreter book to make an interpreter. The first part (the Tree-walk interpreter will be implemented in C#). Then I will do the second part in C. I wish to later add additional functionalities that are not present in the book (like static types, arrays and much more...hopefully) and make it my own language
